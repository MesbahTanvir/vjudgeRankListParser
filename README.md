* This program take indented html code.
* https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html use this to indent html.
* Only the section "&lt;tbody&gt; ......... &lt;/tbody&gt;" should be in input file.
* That section code can be found by inspect tool of chrome from vjudge contest ranklist page.
* There is two input from console/argument  is contest number and input file.
* Output file will be in 'contest**.txt'  (** represent contest number I.E. 01,02,03 etc.);

* This code is not fully automated as you can see that you have to copy the html code
* I can't guarantee that it is bug free
* This code may not work if vjudge update (may be some wise modification can work) their ranklist table formating code.
